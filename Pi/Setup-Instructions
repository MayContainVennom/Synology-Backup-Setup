Pi Setup!

The main role of the Raspberry Pi in this setup is to provide a VPN Gateway for the Synology to Connect 
to the Dedi.

Bellow are the Guides I used to Get the Pi up and running:

Open-VPN

Using the Above guide, instead of getting the .ovpn file from a VPN provider we instead need to get this from the one we Created on the Dedi. Other than this the setup is Identicle.


Also in this folder you will see a Python Script that is used to Ping the Dedi and Display on a PiLite the outcome. Not required for this setup
but its something I worked on for this project.
